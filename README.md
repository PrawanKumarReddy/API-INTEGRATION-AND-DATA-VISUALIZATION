DESCRIPTION

Tools Used:

Requests Library (Python): The requests library is used to send HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API. It allows us to retrieve weather data in JSON format, which is easy to parse and use in the program.

Matplotlib (Python): matplotlib is a powerful library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python. In this project, it is used to generate a bar chart that displays temperature and humidity data.

OpenWeatherMap API: penWeatherMap provides real-time weather data such as temperature, humidity, weather conditions, etc. In this project, it is used to fetch the current weather data of a specified city.

APPLICABLE FOR

Weather Applications: This project is relevant for building simple weather applications or dashboards where users can get up-to-date weather data.

Data Science & Analytics: It can be used as an introductory project for learning how to work with APIs, handle JSON data, and create basic visualizations in Python.

IoT and Smart Devices: This weather data can be integrated into smart home systems or IoT devices that require real-time environmental data for decision-making or automation.
